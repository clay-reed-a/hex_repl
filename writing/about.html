<h2>What is this? </h2>

<p>Hex Color REPL helps you learn hex color codes. <a href="http://claytonalbachten.com" title="Clayton's personal site">Clayton</a> wanted to write hex color codes without a tool like Photoshop open. He knew he needed to practice seeing what codes made what colors.</p>

<p>When learning to program, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop" title="Wikipedia article for REPLs">REPLs</a> helped Clayton see what certain codes meant. With a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop" title="Wikipedia article for REPLs">REPL</a>, you can write some code, and the REPL responds with what it means. He found if he practiced writing a code and seeing how the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop" title="Wikipedia article for REPLs">REPL</a> responded, he understood the code much better.  So, when he wanted to learn hex, he made a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop" title="Wikipedia article for REPLs">REPL</a> just for hex color codes, because there wasn&rsquo;t one.</p>
