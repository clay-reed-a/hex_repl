###What is this?

Hex Color REPL helps you learn hex color codes. [Clayton][] wanted to write hex color codes without a tool like Photoshop open. He knew he needed to practice seeing what codes made what colors. 

When learning to program, [REPLs][REPL] helped Clayton see what certain codes meant. With a [REPL][], you can write some code, and the REPL responds with what it means. He found if he practiced writing a code and seeing how the [REPL][] responded, he understood the code much better.  So, when he wanted to learn hex, he made a [REPL][] just for hex color codes, because there wasn't one. 

For some examples of [REPLs][REPL], look at [SLIME's][SLIME] [REPL][], [`pry`][pry] or your browser's JavaScript console.
