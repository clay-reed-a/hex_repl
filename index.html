					<h3>What is this?</h3>

<p>Hex Color REPL helps you learn hex color codes. <a href="http://claytonalbachten.com" title="Clayton's personal site">Clayton</a> wanted to write hex color codes without a tool like Photoshop open. He knew he needed to practice seeing what codes made what colors.</p>

<p>When learning to program, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop" title="Wikipedia article for REPLs">REPLs</a> helped Clayton see what certain codes meant. With a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop" title="Wikipedia article for REPLs">REPL</a>, you can write some code, and the REPL responds with what it means. He found if he practiced writing a code and seeing how the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop" title="Wikipedia article for REPLs">REPL</a> responded, he understood the code much better.  So, when he wanted to learn hex, he made a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop" title="Wikipedia article for REPLs">REPL</a> just for hex color codes, because there wasn&rsquo;t one.</p>

<p>For some examples of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop" title="Wikipedia article for REPLs">REPLs</a>, look at <a href="http://common-lisp.net/project/slime/" title="Offical page for SLIME">SLIME&rsquo;s</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop" title="Wikipedia article for REPLs">REPL</a>, <a href="http://pryrepl.org/" title="Offical page for pry"><code>pry</code></a> or your browser&rsquo;s JavaScript console.</p>

					<h2>Confused? </h2>

<h3>What are hex color codes?</h3>

<p>Hex color codes are a way to tell a browser what color you want a part of a webpage to be.</p>

<h3>I know <em>THAT</em>, but how do I make one?</h3>

<p>Hex color codes are formed from three numbers. Each number stands for a certain color. The first number is for red, the second is for green &amp; the third is for blue. If you mix these colors together, you can get more colors.</p>

<p>Each number is two digits long, but, instead of going from just <code>0</code> to <code>9</code>, each digit can go all the way up to <code>f</code>.</p>

<h3>But <code>f</code> isn&rsquo;t a number!</h3>

<p><code>a</code> continues from where <code>9</code> left by meaning 10. This way <code>b</code> can mean 11 and <code>c</code> 12, all the way up to <code>f</code>, which is 15. So you can count all the way to 15 only using one digit. With two digits you can go to 255.</p>

<h3>Why do I need to do that?</h3>

<p>How big or small the number is tells how much to add of a certain color to get the color you want. If the number for blue is <code>00</code>, you do not need any blue to get the color you want. If the number for blue is <code>ff</code>, you need as much blue as you can get. We use the letters in hex to get as big a number as we can w/o having to write so many digits.</p>

<h3>OK, how many colors can I get?</h3>

<p>You can make 16,777,216 different colors with hex color codes.</p>

<p>When you have some slots to put symbols in, start by count all the symbols you can put in each slot. How many combinations you can make is the number of symbols you have taken to the power of how many slots you have.</p>

<p>With hex, for each color slot we can count to 255, but we can also say zero. So any of the three colors has 256 symbols. If you cube 256, you get 16,777,216.</p>

<p>There are so many hex colors, it is hard to remember how to make the colors you want. I made this site because I wanted to be able to play with hex colors until I understood them. If you play with it, I think you&rsquo;ll start to get a feeling for the patterns. Then maybe you&rsquo;ll not have to use it anymore when you want a hex color.</p>

<h3>I wanna make purple. No, actually I wanna make my favorite kind of green.</h3>

<p>If there&rsquo;s a color you add more of than you do the other two, that color will always decide what color you get. Adding a little bit more or a little bit less of the other two colors will change it.</p>

<p>If you add mostly blue and red, you&rsquo;ll get purple. If you add mostly green and red, you&rsquo;ll get yellow. Adding blue and green together will get you some interesting blues, like teal and cyan.</p>

<p>The weird thing is that if you add hardly any colors at all, you&rsquo;ll get black or a really dark color. And if you add a whole lot of all the colors, you&rsquo;ll get white. This is because the colors on the screen are made by mixing light together, and, if you don&rsquo;t have any light, it is dark.</p>
